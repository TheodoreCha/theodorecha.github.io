Hi, I am Theo.

I believe that programmers are not people who just write codes. Programmers are people who solve business problems. Just because a programmer has written 10,000 lines of code doesn’t make you a good programmer. Whether it is a thousand lines or ten thousand lines, it is important what business value you create. The business value proves my value, not the coding itself.

I studied BS, Computer Science at Digital Seoul university.

I live in Stockholm as a Swedish Citizen. I speak Korean as my mother language and English and Chinese at a professional level and Swedish at a beginner level.

Cheers! 🤙
